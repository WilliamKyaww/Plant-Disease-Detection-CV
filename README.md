# Computer Vision Plant Disease Classification

Computer vision project for plant disease classification with reproducible training/evaluation workflows.

dataset - kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease, downloaded ~24 Feb 2026, upstream spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset, licensed CC BY-SA 3.0 at source.
## Project Naming Note
As of 2026-03-14, the project title is standardized as `Computer Vision Plant Disease Classification`.
This reflects the current primary scope (15-class disease classification), with severity (0-3) kept as a later optional analysis track.

## Scope (Current)
1. Primary task: 15-class crop+disease classification (PlantVillage folder-level classes).
2. Side analysis: 4-disease subset (healthy, bacterial_spot, early_blight, late_blight).
3. Severity (0-3): parked and optional, only after Phase 1-3 gates are met.

## Environment
Recommended local interpreter: Python 3.13 on this machine.

Install:
```bash
py -3.13 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Runtime support:
1. CPU and GPU are both supported by training scripts.
2. GPU (Colab T4 or better) is strongly recommended for Phase 2 full sweeps.
3. `--amp` is enabled only when CUDA is available; CPU runs use FP32 automatically.

## Data Setup
Place PlantVillage folders under:
`Datasets/<folder_name>/image.jpg`

Expected class folder names are defined in `src/utils.py` under `FOLDER_METADATA`.

## Phase 1 Workflow (Executable)
Run from repo root:

Quick one-command runner (forces Python 3.13):
```bash
run_phase1.bat
```

Equivalent step-by-step commands:
1. Integrity audit (missing/corrupt/exact duplicates/near duplicates) with report artifacts:
```bash
py -3.13 -m src.integrity_report
```

2. Build frozen multi-class labels + stratified splits + split manifest:
```bash
py -3.13 -m src.prepare_splits
```

3. Run script-based baseline smoke training (1 epoch, 15-class):
```bash
py -3.13 -m src.run_baseline_smoke --epochs 1 --batch-size 32 --max-train 128 --max-val 64 --max-test 64
```

4. Run Colab path sanity smoke report:
```bash
py -3.13 -m src.colab_smoke --repo-main .
```

5. Run repeat-run stability check (3 seeds):
```bash
py -3.13 -m src.stability_check --seeds 41,42,43 --epochs 1 --batch-size 32 --max-train 128 --max-val 64 --max-test 64
```

Generated artifacts:
1. `CSV/plantvillage_multiclass_labels.csv`
2. `CSV/plantvillage_train.csv`
3. `CSV/plantvillage_val.csv`
4. `CSV/plantvillage_test.csv`
5. `results/split_manifests/latest_split_manifest.json`
6. `results/integrity_reports/latest_integrity_report.json`
7. `results/integrity_reports/latest_integrity_report.txt`
8. `results/baseline_smoke/latest_metrics_snapshot.json`
9. `results/baseline_smoke/latest_experiment_log.json`
10. `results/baseline_smoke/latest_confusion_matrix.json`
11. `results/baseline_smoke/latest_confusion_matrix.png`
12. `results/colab_smoke/latest_colab_smoke.json`
13. `results/colab_smoke/latest_colab_smoke.txt`
14. `results/stability_checks/latest_stability_check.json`
15. `results/stability_checks/latest_stability_check.txt`

## Notebook Status
1. `notebooks/01_dataset_preparation.ipynb` calls `src.integrity` and `src.prepare_splits`.
2. `notebooks/02_data_pipeline.ipynb` validates dataloaders using `class_label`.
3. `notebooks/03_finetuning_resnet.ipynb` runs a baseline training flow using `src` modules and `ExperimentLog`.
4. `04-06` are intentionally deprecated until the optional severity phase is unlocked.

## Colab Notebooks
1. `Google Colab/phase1_colab_live_smoke_artifact.ipynb`:
   canonical Phase 1 live-Colab smoke evidence notebook.
2. `Google Colab/phase2_benchmark_runner.ipynb`:
   canonical Phase 2 orchestration notebook (dry-run + benchmark commands).
3. `Google Colab/Plant_Disease.ipynb`:
   legacy context/support notebook retained for history; not canonical workflow.

### Phase 2 Colab Cell Usage
Use cell *headers* (comments) as the source of truth, not absolute cell numbers.

First-time clean run (reviewer on fresh environment):
1. `# Colab setup + repo bootstrap`
2. `# Canonical repo root`
3. `# Frozen split guard + dry-run benchmark` (recommended sanity check)
4. `# Full benchmark run`
5. `# Rebuild full 12-run Phase 2 summary from metrics.json files` (optional on clean full run)
6. `# Export Phase 2 artifacts to a zip and download to your laptop.`

Recovery / incremental run (when stale partial artifacts already exist):
1. `# Colab setup + repo bootstrap`
2. `# Canonical repo root`
3. `# Clear stale seed_41 artifacts before full rerun`
4. `# Full rerun for seed_41 across all 4 models`
5. `# Full benchmark run`
6. `# Rebuild full 12-run Phase 2 summary from metrics.json files`
7. `# Export Phase 2 artifacts to a zip and download to your laptop.`

Why cells 5-7 are conditional:
1. `# Minimal training smoke (1 model, 1 seed, 1 epoch)` is an early pipeline sanity check only.
2. `# Clear stale seed_41 artifacts before full rerun` is only needed if old `seed_41` run files exist and would be skipped by `--resume`.
3. `# Full rerun for seed_41 across all 4 models` is only needed to repair incomplete seed coverage (for example, old 1-epoch seed-41 artifacts).

### Phase 2 Colab Continuation Note
1. If Colab GPU quota expires, Phase 2 can be resumed from another Colab account/session as long as the same persisted Google Drive project folder is reused.
2. In that case, the runtime is fresh but the experiment state is not: checkpoints, split manifests, logs, and partial artifacts continue from prior state.
3. This should be treated as a recovery/continuation run, not a brand-new benchmark run.

## Phase 2 Cross-Platform Guardrails
1. Split validation is strict by content and hash, with CSV line-ending normalization support in `src/split_guard.py`.
2. This prevents false hash mismatches when the same CSV content is produced on Windows (CRLF) vs Linux/Colab (LF).
3. Non-line-ending content changes still fail validation.

## Reproducibility Logging
Use `src/experiment_log.py` to record:
1. Hyperparameters and seed
2. Metrics
3. Environment metadata
4. Git commit hash
5. Split artifact metadata (CSV hashes + class counts + seed)
6. GPU metadata on CUDA devices (with compatibility handling for PyTorch device property naming).

## Phase 2 Analysis
Use script-based analysis as the canonical reporting path.

Generate comparison plots and aggregate summaries from existing benchmark artifacts:
```bash
py -3.13 -m src.phase2_analysis
```

Outputs:
1. `results/phase2/analysis/analysis_summary.json`
2. `results/phase2/analysis/plots/metric_summary.png`
3. `results/phase2/analysis/plots/seed_variance.png`
4. `results/phase2/analysis/plots/efficiency_tradeoff.png`
5. `results/phase2/analysis/plots/loss_curves.png`
6. `results/phase2/analysis/plots/accuracy_curves.png`
7. `results/phase2/analysis/plots/mean_confusion_heatmaps.png`
8. `results/phase2/analysis/plots/top_confusions.png`

Checkpoint-based wrong-image extraction is handled separately:
```bash
py -3.13 -m src.phase2_error_analysis --models all
```

Important note:
1. `src.phase2_error_analysis` validates local checkpoint hashes against the run logs.
2. If local `models/phase2/.../best.pth` files do not match the imported benchmark artifacts, the script will stop rather than generate misleading mistake galleries.

## Product Release Candidate Export

The original 4-model x 3-seed Phase 2 benchmark remains unchanged. Its recorded
EfficientNet-B0 seed-41 checkpoint was not available for product integration, so
a distinct EfficientNet-B0 seed-44 replacement candidate was trained on
2026-07-17. It is not a fourth benchmark seed and must not be added to the
historical aggregate tables.

Canonical recovery notebook:

```text
Google Colab/mvp_efficientnet_release_candidate.ipynb
```

The notebook performs dataset integrity checking, validates the isolated
candidate configuration, trains one release candidate, strictly reloads the
state dictionary, and exports provenance plus evaluation evidence. The recovered
candidate achieved controlled PlantVillage test accuracy `0.997093` and macro F1
`0.997616`; these are controlled-domain values, not field-performance claims.

`src/export_model_release.py` converts the reviewed candidate archive into the
governed product bundle. It anchors the reviewed candidate ZIP hash, candidate
identity, source commit, architecture, seed, class order, checkpoint size/hash,
and strict state-dict load before generating synthetic numerical-parity fixtures.
Raw Colab evidence, model weights, and the final release bundle are stored
privately outside Git. The exported checkpoint SHA-256 is
`667f0d6c9c4031d9290c671913f45dc822efb6050637a9802a064965a495785a`.
